# Login and Registration Form

The poject is about a Login and Registratio form made in a studing of HTML and CSS.

Many websites and applications that require users to authenticate themselves before accessing certain features or content include a login/register form. The form in this case is coded in HTML, CSS, and eventualy needed JavaScript, which are common web development technologies.

I concentrated my efforts as a beginner on learning the fundamental elements of the form, such as the username, password, and email address input fields, as well as the form submission button. 

Utilizing HTML tags, such as input, label, and button tags, to specify the form's structure. After that, CSS was used to style the form, giving it a pleasing appearance.

As for the JavaScript code got used to allow the form to switch between login and registration modes depending on whether the user already has an account or needs to create one.
